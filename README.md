# Face-mask-detection
A small project for face mask detection

1) get_images: A code that uses opencv to extract images from your webcam. stores thwm in the respective directories with just a few clicks.
2) Converting images to data points: A code to convert the images to arrays and store them as pickle files.
3) Model Training: Build a simple convolutional neural network and train it on the data.
4) Designing the game: Use open cv for real time prediciton.

Note: A simple convnet. used only for demonstrative purposes.
